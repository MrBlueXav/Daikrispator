# Description
Experimental music synthesizer or autonomous noise box.

The synth works on its own, sounds are perpetually changing.

If you press switch 1, sounds and effects stop always changing and the LED1 goes white : the synth parameters are frozen. Press once again switch1 and LED1 lights off : unfreeze.

Switch2 is for mute.

Knob1 controls tempo.

Knob2 controls FX : first no fx then just delay then delay + phaser and finally delay + phaser + chorus. (on/off control)
