# Description
This is an adaptation of Dekrispator experimental autonomous music synthesizer.

It runs on Electro-smith Daisy pod platform.

The synth works on its own, sounds are perpetually changing.

No USB Host midi but some controls.

Switch 1: press and sounds and effects will stop always changing and the LED1 goes white : the synth parameters are frozen. Press once again switch1 and LED1 lights off : unfreeze.

Switch2 is for mute.

Knob1 controls tempo.
